    /**
     * An immutable map from config paths to config values. Paths are dot-separated
     * expressions such as <code>foo.bar.baz</code>. Values are as in JSON
     * (booleans, strings, numbers, lists, or objects), represented by
     * {@link config_value} instances. Values accessed through the
     * <code>config</code> interface are never null.
     *
     * <p>
     * {@code config} is an immutable object and thus safe to use from multiple
     * threads. There's never a need for "defensive copies."
     *
     * <p>
     * Fundamental operations on a {@code config} include getting configuration
     * values, <em>resolving</em> substitutions with {@link config#resolve()}, and
     * merging configs using {@link config#with_fallback(config_mergeable)}.
     *
     * <p>
     * All operations return a new immutable {@code config} rather than modifying
     * the original instance.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Examples</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * You can find an example app and library <a
     * href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples">on
     * GitHub</a>. Also be sure to read the <a
     * href="package-summary.html#package_description">package overview</a> which
     * describes the big picture as shown in those examples.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Paths, keys, and config vs. config_object</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * <code>config</code> is a view onto a tree of {@link config_object}; the
     * corresponding object tree can be found through {@link config#root()}.
     * <code>config_object</code> is a map from config <em>keys</em>, rather than
     * paths, to config values. Think of <code>config_object</code> as a JSON object
     * and <code>config</code> as a configuration API.
     *
     * <p>
     * The API tries to consistently use the terms "key" and "path." A key is a key
     * in a JSON object; it's just a string that's the key in a map. A "path" is a
     * parseable expression with a syntax and it refers to a series of keys. Path
     * expressions are described in the <a
     * href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">spec for
     * Human-Optimized Config Object Notation</a>. In brief, a path is
     * period-separated so "a.b.c" looks for key c in object b in object a in the
     * root object. Sometimes double quotes are needed around special characters in
     * path expressions.
     *
     * <p>
     * The API for a {@code config} is in terms of path expressions, while the API
     * for a {@code config_object} is in terms of keys. Conceptually, {@code config}
     * is a one-level map from <em>paths</em> to values, while a
     * {@code config_object} is a tree of nested maps from <em>keys</em> to values.
     *
     * <p>
     * Use {@link config_util#join_path} and {@link config_util#split_path} to convert
     * between path expressions and individual path elements (keys).
     *
     * <p>
     * Another difference between {@code config} and {@code config_object} is that
     * conceptually, {@code config_value}s with a {@link config_value#value_type()
     * value_type()} of {@link config_value_type#NULL NULL} exist in a
     * {@code config_object}, while a {@code config} treats null values as if they
     * were missing. (With the exception of two methods: {@link config#has_path_or_null}
     * and {@link config#get_is_null} let you detect <code>null</code> values.)
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Getting configuration values</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * The "getters" on a {@code config} all work in the same way. They never return
     * null, nor do they return a {@code config_value} with
     * {@link config_value#value_type() value_type()} of {@link config_value_type#NULL
     * NULL}. Instead, they throw {@link config_exception} if the value is
     * completely absent or set to null. If the value is set to null, a subtype of
     * {@code config_exception.missing} called {@link config_exception.null} will be
     * thrown. {@link config_excpetion.wrong_type} will be thrown anytime you ask for
     * a type and the value has an incompatible type. Reasonable type conversions
     * are performed for you though.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Iteration</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * If you want to iterate over the contents of a {@code config}, you can get its
     * {@code config_object} with {@link #root()}, and then iterate over the
     * {@code config_object} (which implements <code>java.util.Map</code>). Or, you
     * can use {@link #entry_set()} which recurses the object tree for you and builds
     * up a <code>set</code> of all path-value pairs where the value is not null.
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Resolving substitutions</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * <em>Substitutions</em> are the <code>${foo.bar}</code> syntax in config
     * files, described in the <a href=
     * "https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#substitutions"
     * >specification</a>. Resolving substitutions replaces these references with real
     * values.
     *
     * <p>
     * Before using a {@code config} it's necessary to call {@link config#resolve()}
     * to handle substitutions (though {@link config_factory#load()} and similar
     * methods will do the resolve for you already).
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Merging</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * The full <code>config</code> for your application can be constructed using
     * the associative operation {@link config#with_fallback(config_mergeable)}. If
     * you use {@link config_factory#load()} (recommended), it merges system
     * properties over the top of <code>application.conf</code> over the top of
     * <code>reference.conf</code>, using <code>with_fallback</code>. You can add in
     * additional sources of configuration in the same way (usually, custom layers
     * should go either just above or just below <code>application.conf</code>,
     * keeping <code>reference.conf</code> at the bottom and system properties at
     * the top).
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Serialization</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * Convert a <code>config</code> to a JSON or HOCON string by calling
     * {@link config_object#render()} on the root object,
     * <code>my_config.root().render()</code>. There's also a variant
     * {@link config_object#render(config_render_options)} which allows you to control
     * the format of the rendered string. (See {@link config_render_options}.) Note
     * that <code>config</code> does not remember the formatting of the original
     * file, so if you load, modify, and re-save a config file, it will be
     * substantially reformatted.
     *
     * <p>
     * As an alternative to {@link config_object#render()}, the
     * <code>to_string()</code> method produces a debug-output-oriented
     * representation (which is not valid JSON).
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>This is an interface but don't implement it yourself</strong>
     *
     * <p>
     * <em>Do not implement {@code config}</em>; it should only be implemented by
     * the config library. Arbitrary implementations will not work because the
     * library internals assume a specific concrete implementation. Also, this
     * interface is likely to grow new methods over time, so third-party
     * implementations will break.

         * substitutions that could have resolved with all fallbacks available may

         * users.
         *
         * <p>
         * <code>resolve()</code> should be invoked on root config objects, rather
         * than on a subtree (a subtree is the result of something like
         * <code>config.get_config("foo")</code>). The problem with
         * <code>resolve()</code> on a subtree is that substitutions are relative to
         * the root of the config and the subtree will have no way to get values
         * from the root. For example, if you did
         * <code>config.get_config("foo").resolve()</code> on the below config file,
         * it would not work:
         *
         * <pre>
         *   common-value = 10

         * If no paths are specified in <code>check_valid()</code>'s parameter list,

         * are ignored. (There's nothing to validate.)
         *
         * <p>
         * Here's what validation involves:
         *
         * <ul>
         * <li>All paths found in the reference config must be present in this
         * config or an exception will be thrown.
         * <li>
         * Some changes in type from the reference config to this config will cause
         * an exception to be thrown. Not all potential type problems are detected,
         * in particular it's assumed that strings are compatible with everything
         * except objects and lists. This is because string types are often "really"
         * some other type (system properties always start out as strings, or a
         * string like "5ms" could be used with {@link #get_milliseconds}). Also,
         * it's allowed to set any type to null or override null with any type.
         * <li>
         * Any unresolved substitutions in this config will cause a validation
         * failure; both the reference config and this config should be resolved
         * before validation. If the reference config is unresolved, it's a bug in
         * the caller of this method.
         * </ul>
         *
         * <p>
         * If you want to allow a certain setting to have a flexible type (or
         * otherwise want validation to be looser for some settings), you could
         * either remove the problematic setting from the reference config provided
         * to this method, or you could intercept the validation exception and
         * screen out certain problems. Of course, this will only work if all other
         * callers of this method are careful to restrict validation to their own
         * paths, as they should be.
         *
         * <p>
         * If validation fails, the thrown exception contains a list of all problems
         * found. The exception will have all the problem concatenated into one huge string.
